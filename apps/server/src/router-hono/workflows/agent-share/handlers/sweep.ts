/**
 * Cron-style sweep for `agent_share_run_reservations` rows abandoned before
 * they ever reached `confirmReservation` or the catch-path
 * `releaseReservation` — e.g. the request process died between
 * `assertRunnableForVisitor` inserting the row and `createOperation`
 * returning. See {@link AgentShareModel.sweepAbandonedReservations} for why
 * this is safe (a belated confirm on a swept row just fails closed, same as
 * a live revocation) and why age, not status, is the only filter needed.
 *
 * Beyond deleting the row, this ALSO calls `AiAgentService.interruptTask` for
 * every swept operation — mirroring `interruptActiveShareRuns`'s handling of
 * `revokeReservations`'s rows. Without this, deleting the reservation only
 * stops a STILL-LIVE originating request from confirming; it does nothing
 * for the far more likely reason a row survives 30 minutes unswept: that
 * request's process died before ever reaching `confirmReservation`; the
 * queue message `createOperation` already scheduled for it keeps executing
 * under the creator's credentials/budget with no topic `runningOperation`
 * marker for the visitor's `interruptTask` to find. Interrupting here closes
 * that window — bounded by `maxAgeMs` (default 30 minutes), see
 * `sweepAbandonedReservations`'s JSDoc for why a proactive, unconditional
 * confirmation gate at step-0 pickup (`AgentRuntimeService.executeStep`'s
 * `verifyShareReservationStatus` delegate call) is the primary defense and
 * this sweep is the bounded backstop for any other failure shape that skips
 * that gate (e.g. a `maxAgeMs`-tuned deploy racing an in-flight
 * `createOperation`).
 *
 * Each row only carries `agentId`, not the creator's `userId` — resolved
 * here via one batched `agents` lookup so `AiAgentService` (and the
 * `TopicModel` it constructs) can be scoped correctly; `interruptTask`'s
 * topic/operation lookups are ownership-filtered by that `userId`. An agent
 * that has since been deleted (no matching row) is skipped — its topics and
 * reservations already cascade-deleted with it (see the FK `onDelete:
 * 'cascade'` on `agentShareRunReservations.agentId`), so there's nothing left
 * to interrupt.
 *
 * No per-user authentication: this is a global scan invoked by the
 * deployment's cron schedule, same pattern as
 * `workflows/verify/handlers/sweep.ts`. Signature verification for the
 * QStash-triggered HTTP path is handled by the `qstashAuth` middleware
 * mounted on the route; a deployment that instead drives this off a plain
 * cron calls {@link runAgentShareReservationSweep} directly (already
 * authenticated at that call site) and never goes through `qstashAuth`.
 *
 * Framework-free core: extracted from the Hono handler so a non-QStash cron
 * caller (e.g. a scheduled route gated by its own auth) can invoke the sweep
 * directly without constructing a Hono `Context`.
