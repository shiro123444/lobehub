 * argument (unsafe for a visitor) or purely from server-side context like
 * `context.agentId` / `context.operationId` (safe). Five review rounds each
 * surfaced one more tool that leaked the creator's whole account under the

 * bottom of this file for what replaced it) precisely because "not yet
 * proven unsafe" defaulted to "exposed." Under this allowlist, a newly
 * registered builtin tool — or a newly added API on an already-allowed one —
 * is exposed to a share visitor ONLY once someone explicitly adds it here
 * with the file:line evidence for why its runtime cannot resolve to the
 * creator's data outside what this specific share/agent grants.
 *

 * (`AgentShareSettings/SettingsContent.tsx`) can import the EXACT same allowlist
 * the server enforces instead of hand-copying identifiers that could drift —
 * see that package's JSDoc for the per-identifier safety evidence and the
 * denied-bucket rationale for every identifier NOT on the list.
 *
 * Governs ONLY builtin tool identifiers (checked via `isBuiltinToolIdentifier`
 * against the real `@lobechat/builtin-tools` registry). MCP servers, market
 * plugins, and custom plugins are a different population, gated exclusively
 * by `filterPluginsByShareGate` (the owner's `enabledToolIds` picker) — they

/**
 * Rationale for every registered builtin identifier that is DENIED — i.e.
 * absent from `SHARE_VISITOR_ALLOWED_IDENTIFIERS` above. Under the old
 * denylist (`SHARE_VISITOR_BLOCKED_IDENTIFIERS`, removed — its members are
 * simply absent from the allowlist now, no separate set needed since the
 * allowlist itself is the single source of truth) an identifier had to be
 * explicitly proven dangerous to be blocked; under the allowlist an
 * identifier has to be explicitly proven safe to be exposed, so this comment
 * exists purely to record the evidence trail for reviewers — the denial
 * itself needs no code beyond "not in the Set above."
 *
 * Confirmed leak paths (a concrete visitor→creator-data route was found):
 *
 * - `lobe-agent-management`: executes in `agentManagementRuntime`
 *   (`apps/server/src/services/toolExecution/serverRuntimes/agentManagement.ts`)
 *   scoped by `userId` (the creator — the run executes as the creator, see
 *   `AgentShareGate`), but `agentId` is a free-form model argument on nearly
 *   every API. `searchAgent` (source: 'user') enumerates the creator's whole
 *   workspace; `getAgentDetail` returns any creator-owned agent's full
 *   config (system prompt included) for an arbitrary id; `createAgent` /
 *   `updateAgent` / `updatePrompt` / `duplicateAgent` / `installPlugin`
 *   persistently mutate the creator's agent collection. `callAgent` is the
 *   sub-agent dispatch API also covered by `SUB_AGENT_DISPATCH_APIS` for
 *   `lobe-agent`, but the rest of this tool has no API worth keeping — fail
 *   closed rather than allowlist API-by-API. Mirrored by
 *   `resolveAgentManagementManifest` returning `null` for `isShareVisitor`
 *   (defense in depth).
 *
 * - `agent-signal-review`: registered by `agentSignalReviewRuntime`
 *   (`serverRuntimes/agentSignalReview.ts:36-74`), which DOES bind `agentId`
 *   server-side (from `context.agentId`, throwing if absent) before building
 *   `createReviewRuntimePrimitives` — but that binding is only the DEFAULT,
 *   not an enforced ceiling. Two independent, previously undocumented holes
 *   were found by tracing `createReviewRuntimePrimitives`
 *   (`apps/server/src/services/agentSignal/services/selfIteration/review/server.ts`),
 *   contradicting an earlier "scoped by `context.operationId`, fails closed"
 *   claim that was never actually traced for this identifier:
 *   1. Cross-agent read: `listManagedSkills` (`server.ts:568-572`) and
 *      `getManagedSkill` (`server.ts:556-567`) both destructure an optional
 *      `agentId` straight out of the model's own tool-call arguments and
 *      prefer it over the bound one — `skillDocumentService.listSkills({
 *      agentId: targetAgentId ?? agentId })`. `SkillManagementDocumentService`
 *      is constructed scoped only to `userId` (the creator), not to a single
 *      agent, so a share visitor can name any OTHER agentId belonging to the
 *      same creator and read that agent's private managed-skill catalog
 *      (name, description, full body via `includeContent: true`) — data that
 *      has nothing to do with the agent this share actually grants access to.
 *   2. Unconditional creator-scoped mutations: `writeMemory` (`server.ts:689-727`)
 *      always durably writes a memory via `runMemoryActionAgent` bound to the
 *      run's `agentId`; `createSkillIfAbsent` (`server.ts:525-555`) and
 *      `replaceSkillContentCAS` (`server.ts:612-672`) always create/overwrite a
 *      managed skill document via `SkillManagementDocumentService`. None of
 *      these are read-only, and `DATA_TOOL_ACCESS_RULES` has no entry for this
 *      identifier — v1 share grants are `none`/`read` only, so there is no
 *      grant that could legitimize any of the three even if the cross-agent
 *      read above were fixed. Removed from the allowlist entirely rather than
 *      narrowed: `AGENT_SIGNAL_REVIEW_TOOL_API_NAMES` is almost entirely
 *      mutations or proposal-lifecycle writes (`shared/apiNames.ts:12-52`),
 *      leaving no worthwhile read-only remainder to carve out.
 *
 * - `lobe-skill-maintainer` / `agent-signal-skill-management`: hidden,
 *   system-only tools (`hidden: true` in `packages/builtin-tools/src/index.ts`)
 *   whose `plugins: [...]` entries belong to the internal Agent Signal
 *   self-iteration agents (`@lobechat/builtin-agents`), not a creator's own
 *   conversational agent — under the current toolset-assembly path
 *   (`apps/server/src/services/aiAgent/index.ts`) neither identifier can reach
 *   a live share-visitor operation's `toolManifestMap`/`enabledToolIds` today.
 *   Their `agentId` IS genuinely context-scoped, not model-suppliable:
 *   `SkillMaintainerExecutionRuntime.resolveAgentId`
 *   (`packages/builtin-tool-skill-maintainer/src/ExecutionRuntime/index.ts:66-69`)
 *   reads only `context.agentId`, and the `{ ...args, agentId }` spread order
 *   (same file, e.g. line 93) overwrites any `agentId` a model tries to
 *   smuggle into `args`; `agentSignalSkillManagementRuntime`
 *   (`apps/server/src/services/toolExecution/serverRuntimes/agentSignalSkillManagement.ts:21-33`)
 *   likewise binds `agentId` from `context` at factory time. Absent here as
 *   defense in depth: every API on both tools (`createSkill` /
 *   `replaceSkillIndex` / `renameSkill` / `createSkillIfAbsent` /
 *   `replaceSkillContentCAS`) WRITES agent-document rows under the creator's
 *   account via `SkillManagementDocumentService`, and a v1 share's
 *   `filePermissionConfig` only ever grants `'read'` or `'none'` — there is
 *   no write grant to honor, so any accidental future path that lets a
 *   share-visitor operation pick up either plugin id must still resolve to
 *   "blocked."
 *
 * - `lobe-task` / `lobe-goal`: `lobe-task` executes in `createTaskRuntime`
 *   (`apps/server/src/services/toolExecution/serverRuntimes/task.ts`) against
 *   `TaskModel`/`taskRouter`, both scoped only by `userId`/`workspaceId` — the
 *   CREATOR's. Every mutating and single-task-read API takes a model-supplied
 *   `identifier` (`deleteTask` task.ts:373, `editTask` task.ts:413,
 *   `setTaskSchedule`/`setTaskVerify` task.ts:551,632, `runTask`/`runTasks`
 *   task.ts:704,747, `updateTaskStatus`/`viewTask` task.ts:786,839) or
 *   `commentId` resolved through `TaskModel.resolve` with NO topic/
 *   conversation check — `TaskModel.resolve`'s `ownership()` filter only
 *   checks `userId`/`workspaceId` (`packages/database/src/models/task.ts:326`).
 *   That lets a visitor read, edit, delete, comment on, reschedule,
 *   reconfigure, or RUN (spending the creator's budget) any task anywhere in
 *   the creator's workspace. `listTasks` (task.ts:521) makes the breadth
 *   explicit: `scope: 'allAgents'` deliberately returns every task across
 *   every agent in the workspace. There is no membership relation to scope a
 *   task to "only tasks from this visitor's topic" (`tasks.currentTopicId`/
 *   `task_topics` track execution runs, not creation), so the fail-closed fix
 *   is to block the whole identifier. `lobe-goal`'s `createGoal`
 *   (`serverRuntimes/index.ts`'s `goalRuntime`) is a thin wrapper that reuses
 *   `taskRuntime.factory(context).createGoal` directly — same
 *   creator/workspace-wide task tracker, same absence of topic scoping, so it
 *   is denied for the identical reason even though it exposes only one API.
 *
 * - `lobe-creds`: `injectCreds`
 *   (`serverRuntimes/creds.ts:97-125`, `ServerCredsService.injectCreds`) takes
 *   a free-form `keys: string[]` and decrypts the matching entries straight
 *   out of the creator's (or workspace's) ENTIRE saved credential store into
 *   the sandbox env — nothing ties `keys` to this agent/share. `listCreds`/
 *   `getByKey`/`saveKVCred` are the same whole-account credential surface.
 *
 * - `lobe-message`: every bot-management API on `MessageDispatcherService`'s
 *   `botProvider` (`serverRuntimes/message/index.ts`) resolves `botId`
 *   straight from model args with no check against `context.agentId`
 *   (`getBotDetail`/`updateBot`/`deleteBot`/`toggleBot`/`connectBot`, lines
 *   293-451) — an arbitrary bot integration credential on the creator's
 *   account. `listMessengers`/`getMessengerDetail`/`unlinkMessenger`/
 *   `setMessengerActiveAgent`/`sendMessengerPush` (lines 458-742) act on the
 *   creator's whole personal messenger account (every platform install, every
 *   linked IM account), not anything scoped to the shared agent.
 *
 * - `lobe-skill-store`: `importFromGitHub`/`importFromUrl`/`importFromZipUrl`/
 *   `importFromMarket` (`serverRuntimes/skillStore.ts:104-230`) fetch
 *   attacker-chosen remote code/zip content and persist it into the creator's
 *   (or workspace's) skill catalog via `SkillImporter` — arbitrary code
 *   supply into the creator's account, gated by nothing but the URL the model
 *   supplies.
 *
 * - `lobe-agent-builder`: `updateConfig`/`updatePrompt`
 *   (`serverRuntimes/agentBuilder.ts:169-282`) resolve `agentId` from
 *   `ctx.editingAgentId ?? ctx.agentId` and then overwrite that agent's
 *   `systemRole`/config wholesale — for the shared agent this IS the agent
 *   the visitor is chatting through, so this is a visitor rewriting the
 *   creator's live agent prompt/config. `installPlugin` (lines 284-377)
 *   installs an arbitrary market MCP plugin (or pins a builtin tool) onto
 *   that same agent as the creator, with no OAuth/consent step.
 *
 * - `lobe-skills`: `findById`/`findByName`
 *   (`serverRuntimes/skills.ts:154-162`) resolve any skill by id/name across
 *   the creator's ENTIRE personal `AgentSkillModel` catalog — scoped only by
 *   `disabledSkillIds` (an opt-out set), with no equivalent of the
 *   `shareAllowedSkillIds` allowlist that the separate `lobe-activator`
 *   runtime already applies to its own embedded skills runtime
 *   (`serverRuntimes/activator.ts:104-112` — which is why `lobe-activator`
 *   IS allowed above; the two tools reach the same underlying skill catalog
 *   through differently-guarded paths).
 *
 * - `lobe-brief`: `createBrief` (`briefRuntime.createBrief`,
 *   `apps/server/src/services/toolExecution/serverRuntimes/brief.ts:60-68`)
 *   unconditionally persists a new row via `BriefModel.create`, constructed
 *   with `context.userId` — the CREATOR (`brief.ts:58`) — and the model-
 *   supplied `title`/`summary`/`actions`/`type` verbatim. Nothing in the
 *   manifest marks it as requiring intervention: `BriefManifest.api` only
 *   sets `humanIntervention: 'required'` on `requestCheckpoint`
 *   (`packages/builtin-tool-brief/src/manifest.ts:60-76`); `createBrief`
 *   (`manifest.ts:14-58`) has no such marker, so a share's
 *   `approvalMode: 'reject'` — which only gates intervention-required calls —
 *   never engages for it. A share visitor can therefore create arbitrary
 *   durable records in the creator's brief collection with no write grant to
 *   authorize it (v1 share grants are `none`/`read` only). A non-persisting,
 *   visitor-scoped `createBrief` was considered and rejected for v1: the
 *   whole point of a brief is to durably notify the creator, so a
 *   "non-persisting" variant would just be a fake success response, not a
 *   real feature — not worth building versus simply withholding the tool.
 *   Removed from the allowlist entirely rather than narrowed:
 *   `requestCheckpoint` also unconditionally persists a brief AND pauses the
 *   run's task (`brief.ts:82-100`), so there is no read-only remainder either.
 *
 * - `lobe-group-agent-builder` / `lobe-group-management`: group-orchestration
 *   tools (member CRUD, dispatch) that operate on the creator's group-agent
 *   collection and membership, with no share-run scoping designed in — same
 *   risk class as `lobe-agent-management` (arbitrary creator-resource
 *   mutation via model-suppliable ids). `lobe-group-agent-builder`'s server
 *   runtime is owned by another in-flight change; this denial does not depend
 *   on or modify that file.
 *
 * Denied for lack of positive safety evidence (no confirmed exploit was
 * required to withhold access — the point of default-deny is that an unproven
 * tool does not ship, full stop):
 *
 * - `lobe-local-system` / `lobe-browser` / `lobe-remote-device`: these proxy
 *   through `deviceGateway` to the creator's own registered physical
 *   device(s) — shell commands (`local-system`), live browser control
 *   (`browser`), and device enumeration/attachment (`remote-device`,
 *   `serverRuntimes/remoteDevice.ts:29-58`). A share visitor executing
 *   arbitrary commands or driving a live browser session on the CREATOR's own
 *   computer/phone is a far larger blast radius than any single data store,
 *   and none of the three re-derive scope from the share.
 *
 * - `lobe-cloud-sandbox`: general-purpose shell/script execution
 *   (`serverRuntimes/cloudSandbox.ts`) authenticated as the creator, including
 *   `lh` CLI credential injection (`preprocessLhCommand`). Unlike the
 *   `lobe-skills` sandbox path (execScript/runCommand there are also denied
 *   via the `lobe-skills` block above), this is the standalone tool with no
 *   skill-catalog scoping at all — arbitrary creator-authenticated code
 *   execution.
 *
 * - `lobe-web-onboarding`: `readDocument`/`updateDocument`
 *   (`serverRuntimes/webOnboarding.ts`) read and WRITE the creator's own
 *   onboarding `SOUL.md` document and persona (`UserPersonaModel`) — a
 *   share-visitor write to the creator's personal onboarding profile, with no
 *   scoping to the shared agent at all.
 *
 * - `lobe-self-feedback-intent` / `agent-signal-reflection` /
 *   `agent-signal-feedback-intent`: hidden, system-only self-iteration tools
 *   for the internal background agents (`@lobechat/builtin-agents`), same
 *   population as `lobe-skill-maintainer` above. Their runtimes resolve
 *   `agentId` from context, not model args, and — like
 *   `agent-signal-review` (allowed above) — appear to fail closed without
 *   full operation/agent context. They are withheld anyway: unlike
 *   `agent-signal-review`, no completed audit pass verified their write paths
 *   (`SkillManagementDocumentService`-backed, same write surface flagged
 *   unsafe for `lobe-skill-maintainer`) as safe, so per the default-deny rule
 *   they stay out until that verification happens.
 *
 * - `lobe-page-agent`: not unsafe — genuinely unreachable for a share
 *   visitor's run, so allowlisting it only let the owner-facing tool picker
 *   confirm a grant no visitor conversation can ever exercise.
 *   `AiAgentService.execAgent`
 *   (`apps/server/src/services/aiAgent/index.ts:1737-1739`) unconditionally
 *   strips `PageAgentIdentifier` from `activePluginIds` whenever
 *   `appContext?.scope !== 'page'`, and the share visitor path
 *   (`shareChat.ts`'s `execAgent` procedure) always builds `appContext` as
 *   `{ topicId: input.topicId }` — it never sets `scope` at all, so this
 *   strip fires on every single visitor turn, unconditionally. `scope:
 *   'page'` is set only when the caller has an open page/document editor
 *   (see `builtin-tool-page-agent`'s client executor: "scope is topic-bound,
 *   not route-bound"), a client-side editing surface a share visitor's
 *   plain-chat conversation has no way to open or signal server-side. Should
 *   the share flow ever grow a page/document-editing surface for visitors,
 *   this identifier can be re-added alongside whatever change threads a real
 *   `scope: 'page'` `appContext` through `shareChat.ts`'s `execAgent` — not
 *   before, since re-adding it without that plumbing would reopen the exact
 *   same "picker promises it, no run can ever use it" gap.
 *
 * - `lobe-user-interaction` / `lobe-activator`: same "picker promises an
 *   unusable grant" class as `lobe-page-agent` above, not a data leak — see
 *   `AGENT_SHARE_ALLOWED_BUILTIN_IDENTIFIERS`'s JSDoc
 *   (`packages/builtin-tools/src/index.ts`) for the full evidence. Every
 *   share run is forced onto `approvalMode: 'reject'`
 *   (`AiAgentService.execAgent`), which blocks any tool call whose
 *   `humanIntervention` isn't `'never'`/unset, with no approver ever present
 *   to unblock it (`GeneralChatAgent.ts`'s `resolve_blocked_tools`).
 *   `lobe-user-interaction`'s only entry point (`askUserQuestion`,
 *   `humanIntervention: 'always'`) therefore never runs, and its other APIs
 *   all require a `requestId` only a successful `askUserQuestion` call
 *   mints — the whole tool is dead weight for a visitor.
 *   `lobe-activator`'s only API (`activateTools`,
 *   `humanIntervention: 'required'`) dies the identical way, though it was
 *   already unreachable in practice: it is never a candidate the
 *   owner-facing picker offers (`getShareToolCandidateIds` draws only from
 *   the agent's `plugins` and `runtimeManagedToolIds`), so
 *   `applyShareGateToToolSet`'s `enabledToolIds` check already stripped it
 *   from every share run before this allowlist mattered. See
 *   `applyShareGateToInterventionRequiredApis` above for the structural fix
 *   that now catches this failure mode generically on every ALLOWED tool's
 *   individual APIs (e.g. `lobe-agent`'s `createPlan` / `createTodos` /
 *   `clearTodos` / `askUserQuestion`), instead of requiring a fourth review
 *   round per newly-discovered instance.
 *
 * SAFE / allowed — see `SHARE_VISITOR_ALLOWED_IDENTIFIERS`'s JSDoc above for
 * `lobe-topic-reference`, `lobe-calculator`, `lobe-web-browsing`,
 * `lobe-image-generation`, `lobe-verify`, `lobe-acceptance-evidence`,
 * `lobe-agent`, `lobe-knowledge-base`, `lobe-user-memory`,
 * `lobe-agent-documents`. `lobe-brief` was removed — see "Confirmed leak
 * paths" above.
 *
 * `agent-signal-review` is NOT on this list — see the "Confirmed leak paths"
 * entry above; it was removed after tracing `createReviewRuntimePrimitives`
 * found a cross-agent read plus unconditional creator-scoped mutations.

/**
 * Sub-agent dispatch is not available in shared visitor runs. This strip runs
