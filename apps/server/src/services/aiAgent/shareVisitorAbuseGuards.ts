/**
 * Re-validate the share is still `link` AND still on the generation the
 * caller observed, from INSIDE the same `agents.id FOR UPDATE` transaction
 * `AgentShareModel.lockOwnedAgentRow` just took (see `shareVisitorAbuseGuards.ts:100`).
 *
 * WHY this must run BEFORE the topic/message INSERT the two guard functions
 * below perform, not only later in `AgentShareModel.assertRunnableForVisitor`:
 * that method re-validates right before `createOperation`, but by then the
 * topic and the visitor's user message it guards are already persisted — a
 * rejection there does not by itself unwind them (see
 * `AiAgentService.execAgentWithReservation`'s `cleanupRejectedShareVisitorTurn`
 * for the defense-in-depth that covers the remaining, unavoidable window
 * between this check and that one). Checking HERE, before any row exists,
 * means an owner who makes the link private — or disables and republishes it,
 * see below — while a visitor's request is mid-flight never gets ANY row
 * written under the stale authorization in the first place;
 * `assertRunnableForVisitor` is a second gate, not the only one.
 *
 * `expectedGeneration`, not merely `visibility === 'link'`, is what closes the
 * disable → re-enable race: `AgentShareModel.create()` mints a brand new
 * `agentShares.id` every disable → re-enable cycle, so a stale request that
 * started under the OLD instance would otherwise pass a bare visibility check
 * (the NEW instance is also `link`) and get `readCurrentVisitorCaps`'s
 * freshly-read `shareId` stamped onto it — silently re-filing a
 * pre-revocation conversation under the REPLACEMENT share. Both
 * `updateVisibility('private')` and `deleteByAgentId` bump
 * `agentShareGenerations` unconditionally (see their JSDoc in
 * `packages/database/src/models/agentShare.ts`), so the generation a visitor
 * observed at `findByShareIdWithAccessCheck` time can never still match after
 * either. Fail closed on any mismatch or non-`link` visibility.

/**
 * Atomically enforce `maxTopicsPerVisitor` at the exact moment a share
 * visitor's new topic is written.
 *
 * `shareChat.ts` runs a `TopicModel.countBySender` pre-check before ever
 * dispatching to `AiAgentService.execAgent` (a fast, UX-only reject that
 * skips wasted agent-config/tool-resolution work for an obviously-over-cap
 * request — see that router's JSDoc), but that read and the actual `topics`
 * INSERT this function performs are two unrelated statements, on two
 * unrelated requests/connections, with nothing serializing them. Concurrent
 * new-topic requests from the same visitor can all observe the same
 * pre-insert count and all insert (see `shareChat.ts:129`).
 *
 * `AgentShareModel.lockOwnedAgentRow` takes `FOR UPDATE` on the SAME
 * `agents.id` row every other share-mutation path locks (`create`,
 * `updateConfig`, `updateVisibility`, `deleteByAgentId`,
 * `assertRunnableForVisitor` — see that method's JSDoc and
 * `withOwnedPersonalAgentLock`'s JSDoc for the full family). The recount and
 * the INSERT both run inside that one locked transaction, so whichever of two
 * concurrent callers loses the lock re-reads the FIRST caller's
 * already-committed topic and correctly rejects instead of also inserting.
 *
 * This used to be a separate `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(...))` keyed by
 * `agentId:visitorUserId` (the idiom `OnboardingService.sendOnboardingFirstMessage`
 * still uses for its own topic-provisioning idempotency,
 * `apps/server/src/services/onboarding/index.ts:587-613`) instead of this row
 * lock. That advisory lock only ever serialized concurrent VISITOR requests
 * against each other — it was a lock disjoint from anything `updateConfig`
 * takes, so a cap read inside it could still straddle a concurrent
 * `updateConfig` reduction: read the OLD (higher) cap, then have the owner's
 * write commit a LOWER one, then insert against the stale number anyway.
 *
 * Reusing the Agent row lock closes that gap for free — see
 * `withOwnedPersonalAgentLock`'s JSDoc for why the advisory lock is not kept
 * ALONGSIDE this one, and for the deadlock analysis of taking this lock from
 * a transaction this function opens itself rather than one `AgentShareModel`
 * opens internally.
 *
 * The cap itself is read via `AgentShareModel.readCurrentVisitorCaps` from
 * INSIDE this same locked transaction — deliberately NOT accepted as a
 * caller-supplied number. `shareChat.ts` resolves `shareConfig` exactly ONCE,
 * at `findByShareIdWithAccessCheck`, long before `AiAgentService` reaches this
 * function (thousands of lines of agent-config/tool/knowledge-base
 * resolution in between). A caller-supplied cap would therefore be that
 * stale snapshot: an owner lowering `maxTopicsPerVisitor` mid-flood would
 * never affect requests already past the initial read, since the locked
 * recount would keep enforcing the OLD, higher number it was handed. Reading
 * fresh here means the recount always compares against whatever the owner
 * has configured right now. See `readCurrentVisitorCaps`'s JSDoc and
 * `isConfigTightening`'s JSDoc (`AgentShareModel`) for why this fix, not a
 * generation bump, is the correct one for these two fields.

 * one topic's), which is acceptable: these transactions are a single
 * count-then-insert each, no external I/O, and `assertRunnableForVisitor`
 * already takes this exact row lock once per run start on the very same
 * request path — this is not a new contention point, only the same one
 * applied consistently.
 *
 * Same stale-snapshot fix as {@link reserveShareVisitorTopicOrThrow}: the cap
 * is read fresh via `AgentShareModel.readCurrentVisitorCaps` from inside this
 * locked transaction (hence `agentId` is now a required param) rather than
 * accepted as a caller-supplied number carried forward from `shareChat.ts`'s
