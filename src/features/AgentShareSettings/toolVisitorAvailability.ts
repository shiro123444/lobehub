/**
 * Whether a tool the owner has configured on the agent can ever be granted to
 * a share visitor's run. Delegates to `@lobechat/builtin-tools`'s
 * `isAgentShareAllowedBuiltinIdentifier` — the exact predicate the server-side
 * visitor gate (`apps/server/src/services/aiAgent/shareGate.ts`) enforces at
 * both tool-set assembly and dispatch time — so the settings picker never
 * confirms a grant the server can never honor. Non-builtin identifiers (MCP
 * servers, market plugins, custom plugins) are always available here: they
 * are governed only by the owner's `enabledToolIds` picker, not the builtin
 * allowlist.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP: a `stdio` / local-network MCP connector
 * is a non-builtin identifier, so this predicate has no way to see its
 * connection type and always reports it available once the owner enables it.
 * That class of connector actually tunnels to the OWNER's own paired device
 * at execution time (see `resolveMcpTunnelTarget` in
 * `apps/server/src/services/toolExecution/index.ts`, which always resolves
 * `context.userId` — the creator for a share run, never the visitor). The
 * dispatch layer (`executeMCPTool`'s `context.agentShare` check, same file)
 * fails the call closed instead of tunneling, so the owner sees an accurate
 * "not available" toggle only once server enforcement is in place — this
 * client picker does not yet reflect that as a disabled row. Filtering it
 * here would need connector metadata (`customParams.mcp.type` /
 * `mcpConnectionType`) threaded into this predicate's signature, which no
 * caller currently provides.

 * `lobe-task` or `lobe-agent-management`. Rendering those as selected would
 * confirm a grant no visitor run can ever actually use.
 *
 * Intentionally non-destructive: the underlying persisted config is left
 * alone (the server gate ignores the denied id regardless), so if the
 * identifier is ever added to the allowlist, the existing grant becomes
