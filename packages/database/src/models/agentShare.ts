/**
 * Whether `patch` NARROWS the creator-data surface `previous` already
 * granted — the only kind of `shareConfig` change that must invalidate a run
 * standing on the old grants. Field-by-field, because tightening one field
 * (e.g. dropping a tool) alongside loosening another (e.g. enabling
 * `allowReadMemory`) must still be treated as a tightening overall: a
 * visitor's in-flight run could otherwise keep reading data the owner just
 * tried to lock down.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes `maxTopicsPerVisitor` / `maxTurnsPerTopic` and
 * `uploadAllowed`, but for two DIFFERENT reasons — do not conflate them:
 *
 * - `maxTopicsPerVisitor` / `maxTurnsPerTopic` gate a NEW resource being
 *   created (a topic/turn that does not exist yet), never access to data an
 *   ALREADY-STANDING run is holding — so there is no in-flight run whose
 *   grants need invalidating. This is NOT the same as "re-read fresh
 *   per-call and therefore safe to ignore here": an earlier version of this
 *   comment claimed `shareChat.ts` re-reads them fresh on every call, but the
 *   value it read was still `AgentShareGate.shareConfig` — a snapshot taken
 *   ONCE at `findByShareIdWithAccessCheck`, long before
 *   `reserveShareVisitorTopicOrThrow` / `reserveShareVisitorTurnOrThrow`
 *   actually take the Agent row lock and recount (thousands of lines of
 *   agent-config/tool/knowledge-base resolution later — see those functions'
 *   JSDoc). A concurrent flood already past that initial read would keep
 *   inserting against the OLD, higher cap even after the owner lowered it.
 *   The actual fix for that gap is `AgentShareModel.readCurrentVisitorCaps`,
 *   called by those guard functions from INSIDE their locked transaction
 *   instead of trusting a caller-supplied number — see its JSDoc, and
 *   `lockOwnedAgentRow`'s JSDoc for why that lock is now the SAME
 *   `agents.id FOR UPDATE` every other share mutation takes, not a separate
 *   advisory lock. With that fix, "re-read fresh" is literally true, which is
 *   what makes it safe to
 *   leave these two fields OUT of a mechanism (generation bump + whole-run
 *   invalidation) designed for a different problem: they were never a
 *   run-duration grant to invalidate, only a per-write cap to enforce
 *   correctly at write time. Raising either cap is symmetric and needs no
 *   special handling either: a request that already inserted/rejected
 *   against the OLD, lower value just now has nothing to reconcile against a
 *   LATER increase.
 * - `uploadAllowed` has no runtime enforcement point at all today
 *   (`SettingsContent.tsx` ships it disabled, "coming soon") — nothing to
 *   invalidate. If it is wired into a run-duration grant later, add it here.

   * reduction — read the OLD value, then have the owner's `updateConfig`
   * commit a lower one, then insert against the stale number anyway. Reusing
   * THIS row lock in the guards (via `lockOwnedAgentRow` above) closes that
   * gap for free: a cap read can no longer be concurrent with a config write
   * on the same agent, because both now contend for the same row. The
   * guards' own recount-then-insert was already what the advisory lock
   * existed to serialize (concurrent visitor requests to each other), and the
   * row lock provides that too — just at agent granularity rather than
   * per-visitor/per-topic. Keeping a second, finer-grained lock alongside
   * this one would only have protected visitor-vs-visitor concurrency, which
   * this row lock already covers; it would not have added any additional
   * safety against the config-reduction race the second lock exists for, so
   * dropping it is not a shortcut — it removes a lock that had stopped
   * earning its place. See `shareVisitorAbuseGuards.ts` for the full
   * before/after and the deadlock analysis for stacking this lock into an

   * landing in that window used to be invisible to the in-flight request:
   * `interruptActiveShareRuns`'s post-commit query found no
   * `runningOperation` yet (the operation hadn't been created), and the
   * operation created afterwards was then unstoppable by the visitor
   * (`shareChat.interruptTask` re-checks visibility and gets `FORBIDDEN`).
   * Taking the same row lock revocation/reset use forces one strict
   * ordering: whichever side — this recheck, or a concurrent
   * revoke/config-reset — commits its transaction first is the one the other
   * observes. A revoke that already committed is always seen here, so this
   * run fails closed instead of creating an operation the visitor can no
   * longer stop.
   *
   * Deliberately narrow: only the `visibility` column is re-read (not
   * `isHeterogeneousAgentConfig`, which `updateVisibility` already enforces
   * on the ONLY path that can set `link`) — a broader check would duplicate
   * `writeAgentConfigWithShareReset`'s own heterogeneity gate and risk
   * drifting from it.
   *
   * This recheck alone only closes the window up to THIS transaction's
   * commit — `createOperation` (gateway init, state persistence, queue
   * scheduling) still runs afterwards, unlocked, and can take arbitrarily
   * long. To close THAT window too, insert the durable
   * `agentShareRunReservations` row in the SAME transaction as the
   * visibility recheck (before releasing the lock), not after: a revoke that
   * commits any time later — seconds or minutes into a slow `createOperation`
   * — will always find and revoke this row (`revokeReservations`), and the
   * run's own `confirmReservation` call, right before it commits to actually
   * running, fails closed if it was. See `agentShareRunReservations`'s JSDoc
   * for why this replaces the previous bounded-retry stopgap.
   *
   * `expectedGeneration` closes a SIBLING window: `shareConfig` (tool
   * allowlist, memory/file grants) is resolved once, at `shareChat.ts`'s
   * `findByShareIdWithAccessCheck`, and then snapshotted into the run's
   * runtime state for its whole lifetime (`AgentShareGate`,
   * `applyShareGateToAgentConfig`) — the visibility recheck above says
   * nothing about whether that snapshot is still valid. The caller passes
   * the `agentShareGenerations` value it observed alongside that config read;
   * this method re-reads the CURRENT value under the same lock and refuses
   * to stake a reservation unless they match. A tightening write
   * (`updateConfig`) always bumps the generation, so a mismatch here means
   * "this request's config snapshot predates a tightening that has since
   * committed" — fail closed instead of running with stale, over-broad
   * grants. See `agentShareGenerations`'s JSDoc.

   * lock is taken. `AiAgentService.execAgentWithReservation` does thousands
   * of lines of agent-config/tool/knowledge-base resolution in between (real

   *
   * This is deliberately a much lighter fix than the generation-bump +
   * whole-run invalidation `isConfigTightening` drives for `allowReadMemory` /
   * `enabledToolIds` / `filePermissionConfig`: those fields gate ongoing

   * gate whether a NEW topic/turn may be created — there is no in-flight run

   * number. See `isConfigTightening`'s JSDoc for why these two fields stay

   * are simultaneously true.
   *

   * is why `maxAgeMs` must stay comfortably above any realistic
   * `createOperation` duration (gateway registration + state persistence +
   * queue scheduling): the default mirrors `VERIFY_ABANDONED_MS`

   * before ever reaching `confirmReservation` (the exact case this sweep

   * `createOperation` already scheduled keeps running under the creator's
   * credentials with no topic marker to interrupt it by. `sweep.ts`'s handler
   * closes that gap by actively calling `AiAgentService.interruptTask` on
   * every row this method returns, exactly like `interruptActiveShareRuns`
   * already does for `revokeReservations`'s rows — this method intentionally
   * returns `agentId` (unlike `revokeReservations`) so that handler can
   * resolve each row's owner and do the same.
   *
   * A plain module function, not an `AgentShareModel` instance method: the
   * sweep is agent/owner-agnostic (it scans the whole table), so there is no
   * single `userId` to construct an instance around.
   *
   * Returns `agentId` alongside `operationId`/`topicId` (unlike the shape
   * `revokeReservations` returns) because the sweep handler has no
   * request-scoped owner to build an `AiAgentService` from the way
   * `interruptActiveShareRunsAfterResponse` does — it must resolve the
