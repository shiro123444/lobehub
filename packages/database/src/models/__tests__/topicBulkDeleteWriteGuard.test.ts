/**
 * Structural guard against bulk deletes bypassing visitor-run interruption.
 *
 * A share-visitor topic is owned by the creator (`topics.userId` = creator,
 * `topics.senderId` = visitor — see `utils/shareVisitor.ts`), so ANY raw bulk
 * delete against the `topics` (or `messages`) table that matches on the
 * creator's own scope (`userId` / `workspaceId`) — as opposed to a single
 * already-authorized row — matches a visitor's row too, unless it first
 * snapshots the visitor's in-flight `runningOperation` and hands it to
 * `AiAgentService.interruptTask`. `TopicModel.deleteAll()` (the checked
 * `topic.removeAllTopics` router path) shipped exactly that bug: a visitor's
 * running topic was deleted with no interrupt, the operation row survived
 * with `topicId` set to null, and the visitor's `shareChat.interruptTask`
 * could no longer find the topic to authorize the stop — see
 * `TopicModelOptions.onShareRunsInterrupted`'s JSDoc for the fix.
 *
 * `agents`, `chatGroups` and `sessions` are covered by the SAME pattern for
 * the SAME reason: `topics.agentId` / `topics.groupId` / `topics.sessionId`
 * all cascade off those tables (see `schemas/topic.ts`), so a raw bulk delete
 * against any of them removes a visitor's topic just as directly as deleting
 * `topics` itself. `AgentGroupRepository.removeAgentsFromGroup`'s raw
 * `trx.delete(agents)` on a group's owned virtual members shipped exactly
 * that bug — a published agent's topic (and its `agentShares` row) was
 * cascaded away mid-run with no snapshot or interrupt, so the run kept
 * executing with the creator's credentials until the next per-step
 * authorization check. Scanning `packages/database/src` recursively already
 * covers `repositories/**`, not just `models/**` — that repository file is
 * where this pattern was first missed.
 *
 * This test does not verify the snapshot-and-interrupt contract is followed
 * CORRECTLY inside an allowed file (the model-level tests, e.g.
 * `topic.test.ts` / `session.test.ts` / `chatGroup.test.ts` /
 * `repositories/agentGroup/index.test.ts`, do that) — it only makes sure a
 * FUTURE raw `.delete(topics)` / `.delete(messages)` / `.delete(agents)` /
 * `.delete(chatGroups)` / `.delete(sessions)` write cannot land silently: a
 * new file matching the pattern fails this test until a human either wires
 * the same `onShareRunsInterrupted` contract or documents in `ALLOWED_FILES`
 * below why this particular delete cannot reach a share-visitor row.
