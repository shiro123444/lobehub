   * It does NOT stop an operation that is already running against the OLD
   * (now-invalid) config snapshot under the creator's credentials/budget —
   * that requires `AiAgentService.interruptActiveShareRuns`, which lives in
   * `apps/server` and this package (`packages/database`) cannot import. Every
   * caller that CAN reach the server layer (a tRPC procedure, a tool
   * executor, an OpenAPI controller) MUST pass a callback here that schedules
   * that interrupt (typically via `after()`), mirroring what
   * `agentShareRouter.disableShare` / `updateVisibility` already do for
   * explicit revocation.
   *
   * `revocationGeneration` is the EXACT value this function itself just
   * bumped `agentShareGenerations` to as part of the SAME transaction as the
   * reset — pass it straight through to `interruptActiveShareRuns`, never a
   * value re-read at callback time. See `agentShareGenerations`'s JSDoc
   * (`../schemas/agentShare.ts`) and that method's JSDoc for why.

 *
 * This is the single choke point for the invariant "an agent's `link` share
 * must never survive a write that turns its config heterogeneous" (e.g.
 * switching to Codex / Claude Code — see `isHeterogeneousAgentConfig`).
 * `AiAgentService` fail-closes every visitor run against a heterogeneous
 * share (`ShareHeterogeneousAgentUnsupported`), but that gate only runs at
 * share-time — it never re-checks a share that was already public when the
 * underlying agent config changes later. Without this reset, the owner's
 * Share tab silently disappears while existing recipients keep hitting a
 * live-looking link whose every send fails.
 *
 * EVERY writer of `agents.model` / `agents.agencyConfig` MUST route through
 * this helper instead of duplicating the lock + reset SQL inline. Known
 * callers:
 * - `AgentModel.updateConfig` (packages/database/src/models/agent.ts) — chat
 *   client and the agent-builder tool.
 * - `AgentService.updateAgent`
 *   (packages/openapi/src/services/agent.service.ts) — `PATCH
 *   /api/v1/agents/:id`. This endpoint used to write `agents` directly with
 *   `tx.update(agents)`, bypassing `updateConfig` (and this reset) entirely,
 *   so a published homogeneous agent could be flipped to a heterogeneous
 *   model over the OpenAPI while its share stayed `link`.
 *
 * `AgentShareModel.updateVisibility` (packages/database/src/models/
 * agentShare.ts) takes the SAME row lock (`agents.id = agentId` FOR UPDATE)
 * before publishing a share to `link`, so whichever of the two writers wins
 * the row lock decides the outcome and the other observes its committed
 * result instead of interleaving.
