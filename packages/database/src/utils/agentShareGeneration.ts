/**
 * Bump (and durably persist) the monotonic restrictive-change generation
 * counter for an agent's share. MUST be called inside the SAME `agents.id
 * FOR UPDATE` transaction the caller already holds
 * (`AgentShareModel.withOwnedPersonalAgentLock` / the lock
 * `writeAgentConfigWithShareReset` takes itself) — every writer of this
 * counter and every reader of it (`assertRunnableForVisitor`) goes through
 * that SAME physical row lock, which is what makes "read current generation,
 * compare, stake a reservation at it" and "bump generation, capture the new
 * value as a revocation cutoff" strictly ordered instead of racing. See
 * `agentShareGenerations`'s JSDoc (`../schemas/agentShare.ts`) for why this
 * lives in its own table.
 *
 * Upsert, not a plain `UPDATE`: the counter row may not exist yet (no
 * restrictive change has ever happened for this agent), in which case the
 * implicit baseline is `1` (see `readAgentShareGeneration`) and the first
 * bump must land on `2`.
